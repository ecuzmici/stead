# GUARANTEES — stead

S1  `stead check` is deterministic given identical inputs.               SAMPLED
S2  `stead check` makes no network calls.                                ENFORCED
S3  The status column is never hand-editable without detection.          SAMPLED
S4  `stead check` accepts exactly the grammar in FORMAT.md.              SAMPLED   given T1

## Given
T1  FORMAT.md v0.1 is the intended grammar; the parser tests cover its rules.

## Out of scope
Performance of anchored check commands; behavior of anchors that are
themselves nondeterministic or networked; prose quality of guarantee text.
