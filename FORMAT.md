# The Stead format — v0.1

This file is the specification. The `stead` CLI implements it; the skill
decks reference it. Where the CLI and this file disagree, this file wins
and the CLI has a bug.

Stead splits a repository into two layers:

- **Human layer** — `GUARANTEES.md`, one small signed file listing what
  the system promises, what those promises rest on, and what was never
  promised. Humans review only this layer.
- **Machine layer** — everything else (`machine/`, implementations,
  proofs, tickets, transcripts, failures). As big and noisy as agents
  need. Never human-reviewed.

The layers are related by **checking**, not maintenance: `stead check`
recomputes every guarantee's status from bound evidence. The file
physically cannot lie.

## 1. GUARANTEES.md grammar

A GUARANTEES.md file has, in order:

1. A title line: `# GUARANTEES — <project>`
2. One or more **guarantee lines**
3. An optional `## Given` section
4. An optional `## Out of scope` section

Blank lines are ignored everywhere. No other content is permitted
between the title and the Given section — the file is meant to be read
in under a minute.

### 1.1 Guarantee lines

```
G1  Every span lands in the report exactly once.   HOLDS
G2  A run never exceeds the LLM spend cap.         ENFORCED  given T1
G3  Drift verdicts ≥95% recall on the corpus.      SAMPLED   given T2
```

Grammar (fields separated by **two or more spaces**):

```
<id>  <text>  <STATUS>  [given <T-refs>]
```

- `<id>` — one or more uppercase letters followed by digits
  (`G1`, `G12`, `S3`). Ids must be unique within the file. `G` is the
  conventional prefix; a project may pick another letter (Stead's own
  file uses `S`).
- `<text>` — one line of plain English. If it does not fit on one line,
  it is more than one guarantee.
- `<STATUS>` — exactly one of the seven statuses in §2. **The status
  column is computed by `stead check` and is never hand-edited.**
- `given <T-refs>` — optional, comma-separated references into the
  Given section (`given T1` or `given T1, T3`). Every referenced `T#`
  must exist.

### 1.2 The Given section

```
## Given
T1  The cost table matches provider pricing.
T2  The eval corpus represents real drift.
```

A **Given** is a load-bearing assumption that reality can falsify but
no checker can. Each line is `T<n>  <one line of plain English>`.

Validity rule: every Given must be referenced by at least one guarantee
line. An unreferenced Given is dead weight and fails validation.

### 1.3 The Out of scope section

```
## Out of scope
Report styling, prompt wording.
```

Free prose. This is the list of things that were **never promised**.
It exists so absence of a guarantee is legible as a decision, not an
oversight.

## 2. Status semantics

Statuses form a ladder of evidence strength. `stead check` computes
each guarantee's status from its anchor (§3); the words below define
what each status is allowed to mean.

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `HOLDS` | Machine-proved. A proof assistant or verifier (Dafny, Verus, …) discharges the obligation with no `assume`s. |
| `ENFORCED` | A runtime or build-time engine rejects violations: database constraints, RLS, CI-blocking lint, write-gating runtimes. Violations cannot land, though the property is not proved in general. |
| `CHECKED` | Model-checked (TLA+, Alloy, …) over a finite state space. |
| `SAMPLED` | Evidence by sampling: property tests, evals, screenshot baselines. The strongest honest tier for statistical claims. |
| `TRUSTED` | Rests entirely on one or more Givens. No checker involved; the `given` refs are the whole story. |
| `OPEN` | Stated, not yet established. The honest starting state. |
| `BROKEN` | Violated right now: an anchored check fails, or bound evidence is missing or has changed. |

**Hard rule — LLM-behavior ceiling.** A guarantee about the behavior of
an LLM (its outputs, judgments, classifications) can never exceed
`SAMPLED`. Anchors declare `"llm_behavior": true` for such guarantees
and `stead check` rejects any tier above SAMPLED for them. There is no
override.

**Computation rule.** A status is never asserted; it is derived:

- No anchor bound to the id → `OPEN`.
- Anchor of kind `trusted` → `TRUSTED` (the guarantee line must carry
  `given` refs; a trusted guarantee with no Given fails validation).
- Anchor of kind `check` / `files`: all evidence passes → the anchor's
  declared `tier`; any evidence fails or is missing → `BROKEN`.

**Friction rule.** Removing or weakening a guarantee line is the
high-friction event. `GUARANTEES.md` and `FORMAT.md` are protected by
CODEOWNERS; edits to them require human sign-off. Adding evidence is
cheap; retracting a promise is not.

## 3. Anchor schema — `.stead/anchors.json`

Anchors bind guarantee ids to evidence. `stead check` reads this file,
re-runs / re-hashes everything, and rewrites only the status column of
GUARANTEES.md.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "anchors": {
    "G1": {
      "kind": "check",
      "tier": "SAMPLED",
      "cmd": "node test/report-property.test.js"
    },
    "G2": {
      "kind": "check",
      "tier": "ENFORCED",
      "cmd": "node test/spend-cap-lint.test.js",
      "llm_behavior": false
    },
    "G3": {
      "kind": "files",
      "tier": "HOLDS",
      "files": {
        "machine/proofs/report.dfy": "sha256:9f2c…",
        "machine/proofs/report-verified.log": "sha256:1b0e…"
      }
    },
    "G4": { "kind": "trusted" }
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `kind` — `"check"` | `"files"` | `"trusted"`.
- `tier` — the status this evidence supports when it passes. Required
  for `check` and `files`; forbidden for `trusted`. Must be one of
  `HOLDS`, `ENFORCED`, `CHECKED`, `SAMPLED`.
- `cmd` — (`check` only) a shell command run from the repo root.
  Exit 0 = evidence passes. Commands must be deterministic and make no
  network calls; `stead check` itself never calls an LLM and never
  touches the network.
- `files` — (`files` only) map of repo-relative path →
  `sha256:<hex>`. Every file must exist and hash-match. A `check`
  anchor may also carry a `files` map; both must pass.
- `llm_behavior` — optional boolean. When `true`, `tier` above
  `SAMPLED` is a validation error (§2 ceiling).

Anchor ids that do not correspond to a guarantee line are a validation
error ("orphan anchor"), as is a `files` entry pointing at a missing
file ("lost anchor"). Lost anchors make the guarantee `BROKEN` and
`stead check` exits non-zero.

---

## 4. The CLI contract

- `stead check` — parse GUARANTEES.md + anchors.json, validate (§1–§3),
  run every anchor, rewrite **only the status column**, exit 0 iff no
  guarantee is `BROKEN` and no validation error occurred. Deterministic:
  same inputs → byte-identical output. No network. No LLM calls, ever —
  the attestor is deterministic glue.
- `stead status` — print the computed table, colorized (respects
  `NO_COLOR`), without rewriting anything.
- `stead init` — scaffold `GUARANTEES.md`, `.stead/anchors.json`, and
  `machine/{tickets,lemmas,failures,transcripts,decisions}/` into a
  target directory.

## 5. Decision-request schema — `machine/decisions/DR-###.md`

Agents never resolve product decisions themselves. When guarantees
conflict, an obligation is unprovable, or intent is ambiguous, the
agent files a decision request and escalates. A DR is markdown with
these sections, in order:

```markdown
# DR-007 — <one-line title>

## Context
What the agent was doing and why it stopped.

## Conflict / counterexample
The concrete thing that cannot be satisfied — a failing obligation, a
counterexample input, two guarantee lines in tension.

## Options
Two or three options, each stated as a concrete GUARANTEES.md diff
(fenced ```diff blocks). Trade-offs in one or two sentences each.

## Decision
Signed by:
Date:
Chosen option:
```

The `Decision` block is filled in by a human. Everything under
`machine/` is regenerable **except** `machine/decisions/` — decisions
are the durable trace of human intent.

---

## 6. Machine-layer convention

```
machine/
  tickets/       agent-facing work decomposition
  lemmas/        reusable proved facts
  failures/      counterexamples and post-mortems, curated
  transcripts/   raw agent sessions
  decisions/     DR-###.md — the only non-regenerable subtree
```

Agents own this tree. Humans never review it. See `machine/README.md`.
